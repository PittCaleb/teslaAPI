# teslaAPI
Tesla API interactive examples

A simple app to allow users to poll and utilize the Tesla API to interrogate their vehicles for data or perform functions.

Full documentation may be found at https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/vehicle/commands/climate

## Usage
```bash
python tesla.py
```

## Authentication
1. Edit code and add email and tesla.com password to the file
2. Edit code and add known token to the file
3. Add environment variable TESLA_API_TOKEN to your system

_Please be careful to not re-distribute code that has your password or token!_ 

## ToDo List
* Interactive authentication
* After token, message user to set as env var for future use
* Parameter based API calls 
* Better user interface
